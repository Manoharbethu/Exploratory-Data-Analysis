# 🍔 McDonald's Nutrition EDA 
The objective of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project was to understand the nutritional content of McDonald's food, identify relationships between different nutrients, and recommend healthier choices for consumers. <br/>
Analysis Focus: McDonald's nutrition data, examining calories, fat, sugar, and other nutrients4.
# 💻 Technical Details and FindingsProject SetupLibraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy
Dataset Overview: The initial dataset contained 328 rows and 13 columns. <br/>
Data Cleaning: Null values (3 in 'Calories From Fat' and 3 in 'Weight') were removed. <br/>
Key Findings from AnalysisCorrelation: There is a very strong positive linear relationship between Calories and Weight, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9928. <br/>
General Nutrition: Overall, McDonald's food is high in calories, fat, and sugar9. Sodium intake is a significant concern for many who eat there. <br/>
Healthier Options: Salads, grilled chicken sandwiches, and fruit smoothies are cited as healthier choices compared to burgers, fries, and milkshakes. <br/>
Example Comparison: Among the selected items (Hamburger, Cheeseburger, McDouble), the McDouble has the highest percentage of total calories at 41.5%. <br/>
RecommendationsMcDonald's should educate consumers about the nutritional content and offer healthier options13.For deeper analysis, the use of Machine Learning models like Decision Trees, K-means, or Natural Language Processing (NLP) is recommended14.
